# Network Traffic Analyzer

In today's fast moving and well connected world, Network Security has evolved as the most important concern for all organizations and users as well. Network Traffic consists of several harmful threats and due to alarming need of high security, NETWORK TRAFFIC ANALYSIS is now a mandatory step for everyone.

In my project, I have analyzed the network traffic and also found the locations of Blacklisted websites along with their geographical indications. I have found the locations of the users who are accessing the blacklisted websites and then depicted the locations visually on the World Map, using Google Map API.

The scripting languages and tools used here include -
1. **Python** - For developing the script and the module for interacting with the Internet.
2. **DPKT Module** - For Packet Decoding and is also used for parsing Wireshark Packet.
3. **Wireshark** - For analyzing the traffic. It is a cross-platform, open source analyzer.
4. **PyGeoIP** - A Python library that links IP addresses to their geographical locations.
